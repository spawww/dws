      <h1>Setting up a Raspberry Pi as a routed wireless access point</h1>
      <p>A Raspberry Pi within an Ethernet network can be used as a
        wireless access point, creating a secondary network. The
        resulting new wireless network is entirely managed by the
        Raspberry Pi.</p>
      <p>If you wish to extend an existing Ethernet network to wireless
        clients, consider instead setting up a <a
          href="file:///C:/Users/vpanini/Downloads/access-point-bridged.md">bridged
          access point.</a></p>
      <pre><code>                                         +- RPi -------+

      <p>A routed wireless access point can be created using the inbuilt
        wireless features of the Raspberry Pi 4, Raspberry Pi 3 or
        Raspberry Pi Zero W, or by using a suitable USB wireless dongle
        that supports access point mode.
        It is possible that some USB dongles may need slight changes to
        their settings. If you are having trouble with a USB wireless
        dongle, please check the <a
          href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/">forums</a>.</p>
      <p>This documentation was tested on a Raspberry Pi 3B running a
        fresh installation of Raspberry Pi OS Buster.</p>
      <p><a name="intro"></a></p>
      <h2>Before you start</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure you have administrative access to your Raspberry Pi.
          The network setup will be modified as part of the
          installation: local access, with screen and keyboard connected
          to your Raspberry Pi, is recommended.</li>
        <li>Connect your Raspberry Pi to the Ethernet network and boot
          the Raspberry Pi OS.</li>
        <li>Ensure the Raspberry Pi OS on your Raspberry Pi is <a
            href="file:///C:/Users/raspbian/updating.md">up-to-date</a>
          and reboot if packages were installed in the process.</li>
        <li>Take note of the IP configuration of the Ethernet network
          the Raspberry Pi is connected to:
          <ul>
            <li>In this document, we assume IP network <code>10.10.0.0/24</code>
              is configured on the Ethernet LAN, and the Raspberry Pi is
              going to manage IP network <code>192.168.4.0/24</code>
              for wireless clients.</li>
            <li>Please select another IP network for wireless, e.g. <code>192.168.10.0/24</code>,
              if IP network <code>192.168.4.0/24</code> is already in
              use by your Ethernet LAN.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Have a wireless client (laptop, smartphone, ...) ready to
          test your new access point.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a name="software-install"></a></p>
      <h2>Install the access point and network management software</h2>
      <p>In order to work as an access point, the Raspberry Pi needs to
        have the <code>hostapd</code> access point software package
        installed:</p>
      <pre><code>sudo apt install hostapd</code></pre>
      <p>Enable the wireless access point service and set it to start
        when your Raspberry Pi boots:</p>
      <pre><code>sudo systemctl unmask hostapd
sudo systemctl enable hostapd</code></pre>
      <p>In order to provide network management services (DNS, DHCP) to
        wireless clients, the Raspberry Pi needs to have the <code>dnsmasq</code>
        software package installed:</p>
      <pre><code>sudo apt install dnsmasq</code></pre>
      <p>Finally, install <code>netfilter-persistent</code> and its
        plugin <code>iptables-persistent</code>. This utilty helps by
        saving firewall rules and restoring them when the Raspberry Pi
        boots:</p>
      <pre><code>sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt install -y netfilter-persistent iptables-persistent</code></pre>
      <p>Software installation is complete. We will configure the
        software packages later on.</p>
      <p><a name="routing"></a></p>
      <h2>Set up the network router</h2>
      <p>The Raspberry Pi will run and manage a standalone wireless
        network. It will also route between the wireless and Ethernet
        networks, providing internet access to wireless clients. If you
        prefer, you can choose to skip the routing by skipping the
        section "Enable routing and IP masquerading" below, and run the
        wireless network in complete isolation.</p>
      <h3>Define the wireless interface IP configuration</h3>
      <p>The Raspberry Pi runs a DHCP server for the wireless network;
        this requires static IP configuration for the wireless interface
        (<code>wlan0</code>) in the Raspberry Pi.
        The Raspberry Pi also acts as the router on the wireless
        network, and as is customary, we will give it the first IP
        address in the network: <code>192.168.4.1</code>.</p>
      <p>To configure the static IP address, edit the configuration file
        for <code>dhcpcd</code> with:</p>
      <pre><code>sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf</code></pre>
      <p>Go to the end of the file and add the following:</p>
      <pre><code>interface wlan0
    static ip_address=192.168.4.1/24
    nohook wpa_supplicant</code></pre>
      <h3>Enable routing and IP masquerading</h3>
      <p>This section configures the Raspberry Pi to let wireless
        clients access computers on the main (Ethernet) network, and
        from there the internet.
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> If you wish to block wireless clients
        from accessing the Ethernet network and the internet, skip this
        section.</p>
      <p>To enable routing, i.e. to allow traffic to flow from one
        network to the other in the Raspberry Pi, create a file using
        the following command, with the contents below:</p>
      <pre><code>sudo nano /etc/sysctl.d/routed-ap.conf</code></pre>
      <p>File contents:</p>
      <pre><code># https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/access-point-routed.md
# Enable IPv4 routing
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1</code></pre>
      <p>Enabling routing will allow hosts from network <code>192.168.4.0/24</code>
        to reach the LAN and the main router towards the internet. In
        order to allow traffic between clients on this foreign wireless
        network and the internet without changing the configuration of
        the main router, the Raspberry Pi can substitute the IP address
        of wireless clients with its own IP address on the LAN using a
        "masquerade" firewall rule.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The main router will see all outgoing traffic from wireless
          clients as coming from the Raspberry Pi, allowing
          communication with the internet.</li>
        <li>The Raspberry Pi will receive all incoming traffic,
          substitute the IP addresses back, and forward traffic to the
          original wireless client.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This process is configured by adding a single firewall rule in
        the Raspberry Pi:</p>
      <pre><code>sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE</code></pre>
      <p>Now save the current firewall rules for IPv4 (including the
        rule above) and IPv6 to be loaded at boot by the <code>netfilter-persistent</code>
        service:</p>
      <pre><code>sudo netfilter-persistent save</code></pre>
      <p>Filtering rules are saved to the directory <code>/etc/iptables/</code>.
        If in the future you change the configuration of your firewall,
        make sure to save the configuration before rebooting.</p>
      <h3>Configure the DHCP and DNS services for the wireless network</h3>
      <p>The DHCP and DNS services are provided by <code>dnsmasq</code>.
        The default configuration file serves as a template for all
        possible configuration options, whereas we only need a few. It
        is easier to start from an empty file.</p>
      <p>Rename the default configuration file and edit a new one:</p>
      <pre><code>sudo mv /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf.orig
sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf</code></pre>
      <p>Add the following to the file and save it:</p>
      <pre><code>interface=wlan0 # Listening interface
dhcp-range=192.168.4.2,192.168.4.20,255.255.255.0,24h
                # Pool of IP addresses served via DHCP
domain=wlan     # Local wireless DNS domain
address=/gw.wlan/192.168.4.1
                # Alias for this router</code></pre>
      <p>The Raspberry Pi will deliver IP addresses between <code>192.168.4.2</code>
        and <code>192.168.4.20</code>, with a lease time of 24 hours,
        to wireless DHCP clients. You should be able to reach the
        Raspberry Pi under the name <code>gw.wlan</code> from wireless
        clients.</p>
      <p>There are many more options for <code>dnsmasq</code>; see the
        default configuration file (<code>/etc/dnsmasq.conf</code>) or
        the <a href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html">online
          documentation</a> for details.</p>
      <p><a name="wifi-cc-rfkill"></a></p>
      <h2>Ensure wireless operation</h2>
      <p>Countries around the world regulate the use of
        telecommunication radio frequency bands to ensure
        interference-free operation.
        The Linux OS helps users <a
href="https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/developers/regulatory/statement">comply</a>
        with these rules by allowing applications to be configured with
        a two-letter "WiFi country code", e.g. <code>US</code> for a
        computer used in the United States.</p>
      <p>In the Raspberry Pi OS, 5 GHz wireless networking is disabled
        until a WiFi country code has been configured by the user,
        usually as part of the initial installation process (see
        wireless configuration pages in this <a
          href="file:///C:/Users/vpanini/Downloads/README.md">section</a>
        for details.)</p>
      <p>To ensure WiFi radio is not blocked on your Raspberry Pi,
        execute the following command:</p>
      <pre><code>sudo rfkill unblock wlan</code></pre>
      <p>This setting will be automatically restored at boot time. We
        will define an appropriate country code in the access point
        software configuration, next.</p>
      <p><a name="ap-config"></a></p>
      <h2>Configure the access point software</h2>
      <p>Create the <code>hostapd</code> configuration file, located at
        <code>/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf</code>, to add the various
        parameters for your new wireless network.</p>
      <pre><code>sudo nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf</code></pre>
      <p>Add the information below to the configuration file. This
        configuration assumes we are using channel 7, with a network
        name of <code>NameOfNetwork</code>, and a password <code>AardvarkBadgerHedgehog</code>.
        Note that the name and password should <strong>not</strong>
        have quotes around them. The passphrase should be between 8 and
        64 characters in length.</p>
      <pre><code>country_code=GB
interface=wlan0
ssid=NameOfNetwork
hw_mode=g
channel=7
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
wpa=2
wpa_passphrase=AardvarkBadgerHedgehog
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=TKIP
rsn_pairwise=CCMP</code></pre>
      <p>Note the line <code>country_code=GB</code>: it configures the
        computer to use the correct wireless frequencies in the United
        Kingdom. <strong>Adapt this line</strong> and specify the
        two-letter ISO code of your country. See <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1">Wikipedia</a>
        for a list of two-letter ISO 3166-1 country codes.</p>
      <p>To use the 5 GHz band, you can change the operations mode from
        <code>hw_mode=g</code> to <code>hw_mode=a</code>. Possible
        values for <code>hw_mode</code> are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a = IEEE 802.11a (5 GHz) (Raspberry Pi 3B+ onwards)</li>
        <li>b = IEEE 802.11b (2.4 GHz)</li>
        <li>g = IEEE 802.11g (2.4 GHz)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that when changing the <code>hw_mode</code>, you may need
        to also change the <code>channel</code> - see <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels">Wikipedia</a>
        for a list of allowed combinations.</p>
      <p><a name="conclusion"></a></p>
      <h2>Run your new wireless access point</h2>
      <p>Now restart your Raspberry Pi and verify that the wireless
        access point becomes automatically available.</p>
      <pre><code>sudo systemctl reboot</code></pre>
      <p>Once your Raspberry Pi has restarted, search for wireless
        networks with your wireless client. The network SSID you
        specified in file <code>/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf</code> should
        now be present, and it should be accessible with the specified
        password.</p>
      <p>If SSH is enabled on the Raspberry Pi, it should be possible to
        connect to it from your wireless client as follows, assuming the
        <code>pi</code> account is present: <code>ssh pi@192.168.4.1</code>
        or <code>ssh pi@gw.wlan</code></p>
      <p>If your wireless client has access to your Raspberry Pi (and
        the internet, if you set up routing), congratulations on setting
        up your new access point!</p>
