    <p><a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vim</a>&nbsp;has
      existed&nbsp;for 23 years, and it’s been used to write&nbsp;<em>millions
        upon millions&nbsp;</em>of lines of code. We caught up with Bram
      Moolenaar, creator of the text editor, to ask him about what he’s
      learned building it over the past two decades, his thoughts
      on&nbsp;<a href="http://neovim.org/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">NeoVim</a>&nbsp;and more. In addition, we posed
      some questions suggested by the Vim hive mind&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/2ip7e4/heres_your_chance_to_ask_bram_moolenaar_a_question/"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Reddit</a>. Check
      out&nbsp;Bram’s answers below.</p>
    <h2>1: What have you learned from maintaining such a large and
      widely-used piece of software for such a long time?</h2>
    <p>I have learned all the different things that one can do wrong.
      Both my own mistakes and what I find in code from others. That Vim
      is written in C does not help, since it makes writing bad code
      easy. Now that computers are much faster and have lots of memory I
      would prefer a compiler that takes work out of the hands of the
      programmer. As a hobby project I’m working on a compiler,
      called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.zimbu.org/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">Zimbu</a>, that does this. Making sure the
      resulting code is fast enough that you could write something like
      Vim with it.</p>
    <span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121"></span>
    <p>Another thing I learned is that one must have a vision for the
      future. Users often request a small new feature that seems easy to
      add. Doing this one feature at a time, without considering the
      direction this is going, often makes it difficult for later
      features to be easily accessible. For Vim every command has to be
      assigned to one or two keystrokes. One key is easier to type, of
      course, thus we need to reserve them for often used commands. But
      what commands will be added in the future? It’s a bit of guessing
      I suppose. Although you might also call it a vision.</p>
    <p>For example, when adding the word object, I decided to use two
      characters: “aw”. It stands for “a word”. I could have made it one
      character, but I just knew that other objects would come later.
      Now we also have “ap” for “a paragraph” and many others. That
      would not have been possible if “a” by itself would have been used
      for the first feature that could use it.</p>
    <h2>2:&nbsp;In a world where many text editors have plugins that
      introduce Vim-like behavior, what do you feel differentiates Vim
      from other editors?&nbsp;Put another way: If Vim is the champion
      of something, what is it the champion of?</h2>
    <p>It requires an investment to learn the Vim commands and keep
      learning tricks to make your daily editing work more efficient.
      What Vim provides is the promise that the things you learned will
      keep on working. Other programs bring out a “new and improved”
      version where functionality has moved around, and it takes a while
      before you can work effectively again. Vim, and Vi before it, has
      set a standard. And you can trust it to keep working on all your
      computers.</p>
    <h2>3:&nbsp;Vim is often criticized for having default options which
      seem counter-intuitive. If you could do the whole thing over
      again, would you change any of the defaults? Would you change any
      behavior?</h2>
    <p>This is part of what I mentioned above: Adding one feature at a
      time. When making changes later, and especially adding features,
      it may require setting an option to get that new feature to avoid
      problems with backwards compatibility. For example, multi-level
      undo makes the “u” command work differently. Thus you need an
      option to disable the old behavior.</p>
    <span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122"></span>
    <p>There are not many things that I would do differently now though.
      I would enable more features by default, such as multi-level undo,
      syntax highlighting and everything triggered by the ‘nocompatible’
      option. Basically what’s in $VIMRTIME/vimrc_example.vim.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, I think a lot of users have their own expectations.
      It’s easy for a user to assume that others have the same
      expectations. In practice users have a lot different preferences.
      So I end up deciding what the default is, and there is always a
      group of users that will complain. I’m trying hard to make that
      group as small as possible.</p>
    <h2>4:&nbsp;NeoVim has been under development for roughly eight
      months. What are your thoughts about it now that it’s gained some
      traction?</h2>
    <p>No idea. Some of the basic choices seem odd and irrelevant for
      the main goals. Such as dropping support for some systems and not
      being backwards compatible. The goals could just as well been
      implemented without that.
    </p>
    <p>A lot of it feels like someone who doesn’t like the old code and
      wants to do it “right.” I can agree that the old code is ugly. But
      it will take an awful lot of effort to make a new implementation.
      It’s a lot like what happened to&nbsp;<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_(text_editor)"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elvis</a>: A rewrite was going to
      make it much better, but it took so long, during which Vim added
      more features, that eventually there are not so many Elvis users.
      And the rewritten Elvis may have nice code, but users don’t notice
      that.</p>
    I do hope that the nice things that NeoVim comes up with can be
    added back to Vim. I mean, who doesn’t want better plugin support, a
    better GUI and embedding? The big question is how to do that, and
    who is going to implement it properly.<br>
    <h2>5:&nbsp;What advice would you give to folks with open source
      projects when it comes to working with and building a community?</h2>
    <p>Nothing specific. Obviously you both need to set good goals, make
      some useful code and advertise properly. A nice looking website
      helps a lot, that’s one thing that NeoVim did right.</p>
    <h2>6:&nbsp;In your years of working on open source software, what’s
      one mistake you’d rather not repeat?</h2>
    <p>Without being specific, I have included code from others trusting
      that it would work, and that they would fix reported problems. And
      often that is true, there are quite a few faithful contributors.
      But sometimes someone just wants to get his feature in, and as
      soon as the things he uses are working, he disappears. And then I
      end up having to fix problems.</p>
    <p>These days I’m a lot more careful about including new features.
      Especially when it’s complex and interferes with several existing
      parts of the code. I’m insisting more often on writing tests and
      documentation before including anything.<span

    <h2>7:&nbsp;What’s the best way to make open source projects
      sustainable?</h2>
    <p>Write nice code. Use white space properly, use good names for
      methods, add comments to explain anything that isn’t obvious, etc.
      If you write ugly code, anyone who intends to fix a bug or add a
      feature will not enjoy his work and likely avoid it next time. I’m
      afraid Vim is not a good example of this.</p>
    <h2>8:&nbsp;How can the community ensure that the Vim project
      succeeds for the foreseeable future?</h2>
    <p>Keep me alive.</p>
    <h2>9:&nbsp;Why do you have such a big focus on charity? Why is your
      charity of choice&nbsp;<a href="http://iccf-holland.org/"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICCF Holland</a>, and why is its
      cause so important to you?</h2>

    We often forget how well we are doing. We complain about the wine
    not tasting well today or the waiter being rude. This actually means
    we can afford to buy wine and go out for dinner, isn’t that great?
    At some point while developing Vim I didn’t have a job and asked for
    sponsoring. Once I got back to a paid job I thought it would be good
    to send that sponsorship money to people who really need it. And it
    turns out Vim users think the same way.
    <p>There are many charities and it’s not always clear who you are
      actually helping. How much money stays in the country of the
      donor? How much gets wasted on administration, transport and other
      things that do not really help the people who are being helped.
      One organisation I worked with had only 30% of the money ending up
      with the child who it was for. Clever bookkeeping makes it look
      like 90% of the money is used. But a large part of it goes to
      staff driving around in Land Cruisers. Not to the small school
      where the child is.</p>
    <p>The project I encountered in Kibaale is completely different. The
      foreigners who work there are volunteers, they have sponsors
      themselves to make it possible to live and work there. All the
      donations for children go to the project and are spent there. Also
      for staff and vehicles, but that’s local staff that then spend
      their money in the country, thus indirectly it helps others. And
      in the end seeing the children grow up, finish their studies and
      find a job is wonderful.</p>
    <h2>10:&nbsp;What does the future hold for Vim?</h2>
    <p><span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-129" class="ezoic-adpicker-ad"></span><span
        class="ezoic-ad large-mobile-banner-1 large-mobile-banner-1129
        adtester-container adtester-container-129"
        data-ez-name="binpress_com-large-mobile-banner-1"
        style="min-height: 250px;"><span
          id="div-gpt-ad-binpress_com-large-mobile-banner-1-0"
          ezaw="300" ezah="250" style="position: relative; z-index: 0;
          padding: 0px; width: 100%; max-width: 1200px; margin-left:
          auto !important; margin-right: auto !important; min-height:
          250px; min-width: 300px;" class="ezoic-ad ezfound"></span></span></p>
    Nothing spectacular. Mainly small improvements. There are a few
    areas that could do with bigger improvements, such as making it
    easier to write and use plugins. But it’s not clear how to do that.
    And plugin managers appear to be filling the gap quite well.
    <p>But you never know what comes up. For example, the undofile
      feature seemed like a “nice to have” item. After a student worked
      on it for a while it wasn’t too much work to include. And now I
      completely rely on it, being able to make some changes, build,
      test and undo when it doesn’t work. It’s certainly possible that
      an idea for a useful feature comes up and gets implemented.</p>
