        Recently, the microSD (secure digital) card in my <a
          href="https://opensource.com/resources/raspberry-pi"
          target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> stopped working. It had been
        in constant use as a server for almost two years, and this
        provided a good opportunity to start fresh and correct a few
        problems. After its initial installation, it began experiencing
        disk problems and the official Raspberry Pi operating system
        (OS) received a significant update (and was renamed from
        Raspbian to Raspberry Pi OS). So I acquired a new microSD card
        and preceded to rebuild.</div>

            <p>Although this Raspberry Pi 3 Model B isn't the latest
              hardware, it is still adequate for running a minimal
              server for various services. I think my original
              installation used the full operating system image that
              includes the graphical user interface and a lot of other
              software packages unnecessary for my needs.</p>
            <p>This step-by-step guide shows how I set up my Raspberry
              Pi with the most minimal configuration to conserve
              precious system resources.</p>
            <h2 id="get-started">Get started</h2>
            <p>To begin, create a new operating system drive for the Pi.
              This requires two things: an OS image file and a microSD
              card.</p>
            <h3 id="raspberry-pi-os-image-file">Download the Raspberry
              Pi OS image file</h3>
            <p>While several operating systems are available, I chose to
              stick to the officially supported OS.</p>
            The first step is to download the newest OS image file from
            the official <a
              href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems"
              target="_blank">Raspberry Pi OS</a> site to a computer you
            can use to write to a microSD card. Three different images
            are offered, and I chose the Raspberry Pi OS Lite. It is the
            smallest OS and includes only the essential files required
            for a base OS, so it will consume the least amount of disk
            space and system RAM. (When I downloaded the OS, the release
            date was August 20, 2020, but it has been updated since
            then. I do not expect any major differences, but as always,
            I recommend reading the release notes.)
            <h3 id="the-microsd-card">Write the OS to the microSD Card</h3>
            <p>The second step is to write the downloaded OS image file
              to the microSD card. My card was used previously, and when
              I inserted it into my Linux desktop, it automatically
              mounted its two existing partitions. I couldn't write the
              image until I unmounted these partitions. To do so, I had
              to determine their path with the <code>lsblk</code>
              command, which identified the device as <code>/dev/mmcblk0</code>:</p>
            <pre><span class="geshifilter"><code class="bash geshifilter-bash"><span class="co4"># </span>lsblk <span class="re5">-p</span></code></span></pre>
            <p>I then unmounted the partitions with the <code>umount</code>
              command:</p>
            <pre><div class="geshifilter"><div class="bash geshifilter-bash"><span class="co0"># umount /dev/mmcblk0p2</span><br>
<span class="co0"># umount /dev/mmcblk0p1</span></div></div></pre>
            <p>Once the partitions are unmounted, write the image file
              to the microSD card. Although there are many graphical
              image-writing tools available, I used the venerable <code>dd</code>
              command:</p>
            <pre><span class="geshifilter"><code class="bash geshifilter-bash"><span class="co4"># </span><span class="kw2">dd</span> <span class="re2">bs</span>=4M <span class="re2">if</span>=<span class="sy0">/</span>home<span class="sy0">/</span>alan<span class="sy0">/</span>Downloads<span class="sy0">/</span>raspios<span class="sy0">/</span><span class="nu0">2020</span>-08-<span class="nu0">20</span>-raspios-buster-armhf-lite.img <span class="re2">of</span>=<span class="sy0">/</span>dev<span class="sy0">/</span>mmcblk0 <span class="re2">status</span>=progress <span class="re2">conv</span>=fsync</code></span></pre>
            <h3 id="boot-the-pi">Boot the Pi</h3>
            <p>You just need a monitor, keyboard, and power adapter to
              access the Raspberry Pi. I also have an Ethernet cable for
              network connectivity, which I prefer over
              wirelessâ€”especially for a dedicated server.</p>
            <p>Insert the microSD card and power on the Pi. Once it
              boots, log in with the default credentials: user <code>pi</code>
              and password <code>raspberry</code>.</p>
            <h2 id="set-the-configuration">Configure the OS</h2>
            <p>Take the following steps to minimize your installation,
              disk space, and memory usage as much as possible. I
              recommend spending time to research each configuration to
              be as correct as possible. There are often several ways to
              apply a configuration, and configuration files and
              directives can be deprecated. Always review a product's
              documentation to ensure you're not applying an outdated
              configuration.</p>
            <h3 id="run-raspi-config">Run raspi-config</h3>
            <p>The main configuration program in Raspberry Pi OS is
              called raspi-config. Run it immediately after logging in:</p>
            <pre><span class="geshifilter"><code class="bash geshifilter-bash"><span class="co4"># </span>raspi-config</code></span></pre>
            <p>It presents an option to expand the root filesystem to
              use all of the available space on the microSD card. After
              taking this option, reboot and log in again.</p>
            <p>Verify that the card's full capacity is being used with
              the <code>df</code> command:</p>
            <pre><span class="geshifilter"><code class="bash geshifilter-bash"><span class="co4"># </span><span class="kw2">df</span> <span class="re5">-h</span></code></span></pre>
            <p>If you need to configure other options, run <code>raspi-config</code>
              again. Some of these will vary according to your
              requirements or preferences. Go through all of them just
              to be sure you don't miss anything. I recommend the
              following changes for best performance. (I will skip the
              sections where I did not make any changes.)</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>System options:</strong> You can set the
                hostname, preferably using a fully qualified domain name
                (FQDN). You can also change your password here, which is
                always highly recommended.</li>
              <li><strong>Interface options:</strong> Enable SSH.</li>
              <li><strong>Performance options:</strong> Reduce GPU
                memory to the lowest setting (16MB).</li>
              <li><strong>Localization options:</strong> Choose your
                time zone, location, and keyboard type.</li>
              <li><strong>Advanced options:</strong> This section
                contains the Expand Filesystem option to expand the root
                filesystem. If you didn't do this above, be sure to do
                it here so that you have access to all storage available
                on the microSD card.</li>
              <li><strong>Update:</strong> Entering the Update section
                immediately checks for an update to the raspi-config
                tool. If an update is available, it will be downloaded
                and applied. Otherwise, raspi-config will re-launch
                after a few seconds.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once you complete these configurations in raspi-config,
              select <strong>Finish</strong> to exit the tool.</p>
            <h3 id="manual-configurations">Manual configurations</h3>
            <p>There are several other changes that I recommend. They
              are all manual changes that require editing certain
              configuration files.</p>
            <h4 id="configure-static-ip">Configure static IP</h4>
            <p>Generally, it is best to configure a server with a static
              IP address. To configure the IP and your default gateway
              (router) and domain name service (DNS) addresses, begin by
              identifying the network interface device with the <code>ip</code>
              command:</p>
            <pre><div class="geshifilter"><div class="bash geshifilter-bash"><span class="co0"># ip link</span><br>
<span class="nu0">1</span>: lo: <span class="sy0">&lt;</span>LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP<span class="sy0">&gt;</span> mtu <span class="nu0">65536</span> qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen <span class="nu0">1000</span><br>

            <p>You also need to know the IP address of your default
              gateway and one or more DNS servers. Add this information
              to the file <code>/etc/dhcpcd.conf</code>&nbsp;(<em>I
                strongly suggest making a backup of this file before
                making changes)</em>:</p>
            <pre><div class="geshifilter"><div class="bash geshifilter-bash"><span class="co0"># cd /etc</span><br>
<span class="co0"># cp -a dhcpcd.conf dhcpcd.conf.original</span></div></div></pre>
            <p>Edit the file as shown:</p>
            <pre><div class="geshifilter"><div class="bash geshifilter-bash"><span class="co0"># vi dhcpcd.conf</span><br>
<br>
<span class="co0"># static IP configuration:</span><br>

            <h4 id="disable-ipv6">Disable IPv6</h4>
            <p>Unless you specifically need to use IPv6, you might
              prefer to disable it. Do this by creating two new files
              that include a one-line directive instructing the Linux
              kernel not to use IPv6.</p>
            <p>First, create the file <code>/etc/sysctl.d/disable-ipv6.conf</code>
              with the line<br>
              <code>net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1</code>:</p>
            <pre><div class="geshifilter"><div class="bash geshifilter-bash"><span class="co0"># cd /etc/sysctl.d</span><br>
<span class="co0"># echo "net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1" &gt; disable-ipv6.conf</span></div></div></pre>
            <p>Then create the file <code>/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-ipv6.conf</code>
              with the line <code>blacklist ipv6</code>:</p>
            <pre><div class="geshifilter"><div class="bash geshifilter-bash"><span class="co0"># cd /etc/modprobe.d</span><br>
<span class="co0"># echo "blacklist ipv6" &gt; blacklist-ipv6.conf</span></div></div></pre>
            <h4 id="disable-wifi-bluetooth-and-audio">Disable WiFi,
              Bluetooth, and audio</h4>
            <p>My server's specific purpose will not need Bluetooth or
              audio. Also, since it's connected with Ethernet, it will
              not use wireless (WiFi). Unless you plan to use them,
              disable them with the following steps.</p>
            <p>Make the following changes to the file <code>/boot/config.txt</code>
              <em>(again, I suggest making a backup of this file)</em>:</p>
            <pre><div class="geshifilter"><div class="bash geshifilter-bash"><span class="co0"># cd /boot</span><br>
<span class="co0"># cp -a config.txt config.txt.original</span></div></div></pre>
            <p>Add the following two directives to the bottom of the
              file to disable Bluetooth and WiFi:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>dtoverlay=disable-bt</code></li>
              <li><code>dtoverlay=disable-wifi</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>These echo commands will do the trick:</p>
            <pre><div class="geshifilter"><div class="bash geshifilter-bash"><span class="co0"># cd /boot</span><br>
<span class="co0"># echo "dtoverlay=disable-bt" &gt;&gt; config.txt</span><br>
<span class="co0"># echo "dtoverlay=disable-wifi" &gt;&gt; config.txt</span></div></div></pre>
            <p>To disable audio, change the parameter <code>dtparam=audio</code>
              to <code>off</code>. You can do this with a short <code>sed</code>
              command:</p>
            <pre><span class="geshifilter"><code class="bash geshifilter-bash"><span class="co4"># </span><span class="kw2">sed</span> <span class="re5">-i</span> <span class="st_h">'/dtparam=audio/c dtparam=audio=off'</span> config.txt</code></span></pre>
            <p>The last step is to disable the WiFi service. Use the <code>systemctl
                mask</code> command:</p>
            <pre><span class="geshifilter"><code class="bash geshifilter-bash">systemctl mask wpa_supplicant.service</code></span></pre>
            <p>You can disable a couple of other services if you won't
              need them:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Disable modem service:</strong>
                <pre><span class="geshifilter"><code class="bash geshifilter-bash">systemctl disable hciuart</code></span></pre>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Disable Avahi-daemon:</strong>
                <pre><span class="geshifilter"><code class="bash geshifilter-bash">systemctl disable avahi-daemon.service</code></span></pre>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="final-steps">Final steps</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Check your memory usage:</strong>
                <pre><span class="geshifilter"><code class="bash geshifilter-bash"><span class="co4"># </span><span class="kw2">free</span> <span class="re5">-h</span></code></span></pre>
                I was astonished: My OS only uses 30MB of RAM.</li>
              <li><strong>Create personal accounts:</strong> It is
                advisable to create user accounts for any individuals
                who will log into this server. You can assign them to
                the sudo group to allow them to issue administrative
                commands. For example, to give a user named George an
                account:
                <pre><div class="geshifilter"><div class="bash geshifilter-bash"><span class="co0"># adduser george</span><br>
<span class="co0"># usermod -a -G adm,sudo,users george</span></div></div></pre>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Get updates:</strong> This is an important
                step. Apply updates to get the latest fixes to the
                Raspberry Pi OS:
                <pre><div class="geshifilter"><div class="bash geshifilter-bash"><span class="co0"># apt update</span><br>
<span class="co0"># apt full-upgrade</span></div></div></pre>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Reboot:</strong> It's a good idea to reboot
                your new server:

              <li><strong>Install Cockpit:</strong> You can install <a
                  href="https://cockpit-project.org/" target="_blank">Cockpit</a>,
                also known as the Linux Web Console, on Raspberry Pi OS.
                It provides an HTML-based interface for managing and
                monitoring your server remotely. I recently wrote about
                <a
                  href="https://opensource.com/article/20/11/cockpit-server-management">getting
                  started with Cockpit</a>. Install it with:
                <pre><span class="geshifilter"><code class="bash geshifilter-bash"><span class="co4"># </span>apt <span class="kw2">install</span> cockpit</code></span></pre>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Now my Raspberry Pi is ready to host a server. I could
              use it for a <a
href="https://opensource.com/article/17/3/building-personal-web-server-raspberry-pi-3">web
                server</a>, a <a
                href="https://opensource.com/article/19/6/raspberry-pi-vpn-server">VPN
                server</a>, a game server such as <a
                href="https://github.com/minetest" target="_blank">Minetest</a>,
              or (as I did) an <a
                href="https://opensource.com/article/18/2/block-ads-raspberry-pi">ad
                blocker based on Pi-Hole</a>.</p>
            <h2 id="keep-old-hardware-alive">Keep old hardware alive</h2>
            <p>Regardless of what hardware you have available, carefully
              minimizing and controlling your operating system and
              packages can keep your&nbsp;resource usage low so that you
              can get the most out of it. This also improves security by
              reducing the number of services and packages available to
              would-be mal-actors trying to exploit a vulnerability.</p>
            <p>So, before you decommission older hardware, consider all
              the possibilities for how it can continue to be used.</p>
