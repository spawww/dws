        <p>Wireless networks have come a long way in the past couple of
          decades. And yet, sustained Wi-Fi speeds are still a vexing
          problem in a lot of situations. A number of things can come
          into play, such as the way your router is set up, whether
          there’s nearby interference, whether you live in an apartment
          building or a separate house, where your microwave sits in
          relation to the rest of your network (yes, really), and how
          far apart your devices are from the router. Fortunately,
          there’s always a way to fix slow transfer speeds.</p>
      </span><span id="intelliTXT" name="intellitxt">
        <p>If you’ve ever messed around with your Wi-Fi router’s
          settings, you’ve probably seen the word “channel.” Most
          routers have the channel set to Auto. But many of us have
          looked through that list of a dozen or so channels and
          wondered what they are, and more importantly, which of the
          channels are faster than the others<em>.</em>&nbsp;Well, some
          channels are indeed much faster — but that doesn’t mean you
          should go ahead and change them just yet. Read on to find out
          more about 802.11 channels, interference, and the difference
          between 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi.</p>
        <p style="">The fastest version of Wi-Fi currently available is
          branded as “Wi-Fi 6,” aka 802.11ax. If you’re wondering why we
          moved to branded naming as opposed to the standard number + a
          signifying letter combination, it’s because there are a lot
          more low-level updates and specification changes to 802.11
          than their used to be. After 802.11ac in 2013, we’ve had .ad,
          .af, 802.11-2016, .ah, .ai, .aj, and .aq. Rather than asking
          people to continue playing “Guess the relevant Wi-Fi
          standard,” somebody decided it would be easier to just call
          the current major consumer version “Wi-Fi 6.” There’s an even
          newer standard, Wi-Fi 6E, which supports signals in the 5-6GHz
          band, but there’s no Wi-Fi 6E hardware to speak of in-market
          yet.<iframe class="teads-resize" style="height: 0px

        <h3>Channels 1, 6, and 11</h3>
        <p>First of all, let’s talk about 2.4GHz, because even in 2020,
          the majority of Wi-Fi installations still use the 2.4GHz band
          in some way. <a
href="http://www.extremetech.com/computing/160837-what-is-802-11ac-and-how-much-faster-than-802-11n-is-it">802.11ac</a>,
          which debuted in 2013, is driving adoption of 5GHz, helped
          along by adoption of 2020’s 802.11ax / Wi-Fi 6 — but thanks to
          backwards compatibility, dual-radio routers and devices, and
          lower-cost peripherals with less expensive chipsets, 2.4GHz
          will continue to reign for a while.</p>
<p><img src="2.4_GHz_Wi-Fi_channels_802.11bg_WLAN.png" alt="2.4GHz WiFi channel diagram" width="640" height="149"></p>
        <p>All versions of Wi-Fi up to and including 802.11n (a, b, g,
          n) operate between the frequencies of 2400 and 2500MHz. These
          100MHz are separated into 14 channels of 20MHz each. As you’ve
          probably worked out, 14 lots of 20MHz is a lot more than
          100MHz — and as a result, every 2.4GHz channel overlaps with
          at least two, if not four, other channels (see diagram above).
          And as you can probably imagine, using overlapping channels is
          bad — in fact, it’s the primary reason
          for&nbsp;poor&nbsp;throughput on your wireless network.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, channels 1, 6, and 11 are spaced far enough
          apart that they don’t overlap. On a non-MIMO setup (i.e.
          802.11 a, b, or g) you should always try to use channel 1, 6,
          or 11. If you use 802.11n with 20MHz channels, stick to
          channels 1, 6, and 11 — if you want to use 40MHz channels, be
          aware that the airwaves might be congested, unless you live in
          a detached house in the middle of nowhere.</p>
        <h3>What channel should you use in a&nbsp;crowded area?</h3>
        <p>If&nbsp;you want maximum throughput and minimal interference,
          channels 1, 6, and 11 are your best choices.
          But&nbsp;depending on other wireless networks in your
          vicinity, one of those channels might be a
          better&nbsp;option&nbsp;than the others.</p>
        <p>For example, if you’re using channel 1, but someone next door
          is annoyingly&nbsp;using channel 2, then your throughput will
          plummet. In that situation, you would have to change to
          channel 11 to completely avoid the interference (though 6
          would be pretty good as well). It might be tempting to use a
          channel other than 1, 6, or 11 — but remember that <em>you</em>
          will then be the cause of interference (and everyone on 1, 6,
          and 11 will stomp on your throughput, anyway).</p>
        <p>In an ideal world, you would talk to your neighbors and get
          every router to use channels 1, 6, or 11. Bear in mind that
          interior walls do a pretty good job of attenuating (weakening)
          a signal. If there’s a brick wall between you and a neighbor,
          you could probably both use channel 1 without interfering with
          each other. But if it’s a thin wall (or there’s lots of
          windows), you should use different channels.</p>
        <p>There are tools that can help you find the clearest channel,
          such as <a href="http://www.vistumbler.net/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Vistumbler</a>. But it’s probably
          faster&nbsp;to just switch between channels 1, 6, and 11 until
          you find one that works well. (If you have two laptops, you
          can copy a file between them to test the throughput of each
          channel.)</p>

            <h3>But what about 5GHz?</h3>
          </span></p>
      </div>
      <p>The great thing about 5GHz (802.11n, 802.11ac, and Wi-Fi 6) is
        that because <a
href="http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/146585-a-closer-look-at-the-wireless-spectrum-crunch">there’s
          much more free space at the higher frequencies</a>, it offers
        23 non-overlapping 20MHz channels. 6GHz should continue this
        trend, with even more frequency space (although with slightly
        worse propagation characteristics).</p>
      <p>Starting with 802.11n and continuing with 802.11ac, wireless
        technology in general became much&nbsp;more advanced than the
        prehistoric days of 802.11b and g. If you own at least a
        decent&nbsp;802.11n or 802.11ac router (i.e. if you bought a
        router in the last several&nbsp;years), it likely has some
        hardware inside that chooses the right channel automatically and
        modifies the output power to maximize throughput and minimize
        interference.</p>
      <p>If you’re using the 5GHz band, and your walls aren’t
        paper-thin, then attenuation and the general lack of 5GHz
        devices should mean there’s little interference in your
        apartment — possibly even allowing you to use the fatter 40, 80,
        and 160MHz channels if you feel like it.</p>
      <p>Eventually, as everyone upgrades to newer hardware and moves
        towards 5GHz, picking the right channel will mostly become a
        thing of the past. There may still be some cases where it makes
        sense to fine-tune your router’s channel selection. But when
        you’re dealing with MIMO setups (up to eight in 802.11ac), it’s
        generally a better idea to let your router do its own thing.
        Eventually, of course, 5GHz will fill up as well — but hopefully
        by then, we’ll have worked out how to use even higher
        frequencies (<a
